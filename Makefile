# Generic Makefile for building and packaging a Nextcloud app which uses npm and
# Composer.
#
# Dependencies:
# * make
# * which
# * curl: used if phpunit and composer are not installed to fetch them from the web
# * tar: for building the archive
# * npm: for building and testing everything JS
#
# If no composer.json is in the app root directory, the Composer step
# will be skipped. The same goes for the package.json which can be located in
# the app root or the js/ directory.
#
# The npm command by launches the npm build script:
#
#    npm run build
#
# The npm test command launches the npm test script:
#
#    npm run test
#
# The idea behind this is to be completely testing and build tool agnostic. All
# build tools and additional package managers should be installed locally in
# your project, since this won't pollute people's global namespace.
#
# The following npm scripts in your package.json install and update the bower
# and npm dependencies and use gulp as build system (notice how everything is
# run from the node_modules folder):
#
#    "scripts": {
#        "test": "node node_modules/gulp-cli/bin/gulp.js karma",
#        "prebuild": "npm install && node_modules/bower/bin/bower install && node_modules/bower/bin/bower update",
#        "build": "node node_modules/gulp-cli/bin/gulp.js"
#    },
